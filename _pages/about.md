Hi! I'm Muni, a second year masters student in [ECE](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/) at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I'm fortunate to be working with [Prof. Varun Jog](https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/vjog/) and [Prof. Po-Ling Loh](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~loh/index.html). My current research interests are in the theoretical aspects of machine learning, optimization and network science. 

Previously, I have worked with [Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~ambedkar/) in the [Statistics and Machine Learning Group](http://sml.csa.iisc.ernet.in/SML/) at [IISc Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). Before that, I was a software engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) in Bangalore. I did my undergrad in [EE](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).
