Hi! I'm Muni, a Junior Fellow in Artificial Intelligence at [Universit√© PSL](https://psl.eu/en). 

I did my PhD in [ECE](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/) at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Varun Jog](https://varunjog.github.io/). My thesis was on the theoretical foundations of adversarial robustness in machine learning. 

Previously, I have worked with [Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~ambedkar/) in the [Statistics and Machine Learning Group](http://sml.csa.iisc.ernet.in/SML/) at [IISc Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). Before that, I was a software engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) in Bangalore. I did my undergrad in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

You can find my CV [**here**](/cv.pdf).
